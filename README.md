Teacher:
The teacher has access to the system with several features. The teacher can access a bank of tests from where they can take a test and assign it to students. The teacher can also access a question bank from where they can select specific questions and add them to the test. The teacher can view tests related to the courses that he teach live, and they can also see the dates of the tests that he created and add more tests. After the test is over, the teacher can view statistics, including the average, median, and more. Additionally, the teacher can check the test and give feedback to the students.
